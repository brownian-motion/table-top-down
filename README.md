# Table, Top-Down!

This is a tool to share a top-down view of a tabletop RPG map using a simple laptop camera.
Eventually, I plan to provide a mechanism for QR codes on figurines to let users display icons representing those figurines instead of a warped projection of those figurines.
Rather than stream the tabletop directly through this application, my goal is to present a simple full-screen UI for use in combination with existing robust screen-sharing applications.

As of now, initial versions of this are free to use under the MIT license. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
I may change this later as needed, especially w.r.t. commercial use.
My primary goal is to distribute this for free to gamers to share their game maps with each other over the internet.
