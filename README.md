# Table, Top-Down!

This is a tool to share a top-down view of a tabletop RPG map using a simple laptop camera.
Eventually, I plan to provide a mechanism for QR codes on figurines to let users display icons representing those figurines instead of a warped projection of those figurines.

PRs are welcome, and suggestions are welcome in the "Issues" tab of this repo.
